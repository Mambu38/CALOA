2 - Installation

Necesites admin privileges.

Installation of CALOA is simple but there is some really important steps that have
to be carefully taken.
Installation is done by an installer which runs all third-party installers usefull
to run CALOA.
If Python 3 is already installed on your computer, it is recommended to uninstall
it to use Anaconda Python 3 instead. Anaconda provides a wide selection of scientific
python libraries. An uninstaller is provided with CALOA Installer to allow you
to easily uninstall Python 3.
Python 2 does not need to be uninstalled.
Installation can be split in 4 parts.

    0 - Connect the spectrometer and the BNC via USB-to-Serial to the computer
        to be used for installation and operating.

    1 - Installing Anaconda Python

Anaconda Python 3.6 environment (env. 0.5 Gb disk space required) was used to write
the CALOA application, and is used during installation and execution.
During installation, an Anaconda installer window will pop up.
Here is a really important step which have to be taken to use CALAO and successfully
run installation.
During Anaconda installation, while encountering Advanced Installation Options,
select "Add Anaconda to the PATH environment variable", if this step is not taken,
installation will not be complete and CALOA will not be usable.
Appearance of cmd.exe window is is normal, they will be closed afterwards.

In the end of installation, after VSCode installation is prompted, install it.
This will need an internet connection, if you do not have one, there is an installer
along with

    2 - Installing PySerial

PySerial is a module used by Python to communicate with serial ports.
This module will be installed automatically, as long as you have correctly
followed previous steps.

    3 - Installing FTDI CDM Drivers

FTDI CDM Drivers is needed for USB-to-Serial interfacing.
A new installation window will pop-up, simply follow the steps given by the
installer.

    4 - Installing CALOA

This is the program that pilots communication with both BNC generator and
Avantes fiber spectrometers.
Installation will be done automatically.

If all went right, you can choose to start the application

3 - Using CALOA

    1 - Starting CALOA

To start CALOA, simply double click on the CALOA short-cut.
Then a console will run, don't close this console manually, this will cause
CALOA to crash.
In this console, some information will be written, please DO NOT interact
with the console while it is starting, wait for GUI to appear.

    2 - Interface overview

On the top of the frame, below menu bar, you can choose your "mode" between
"Normal" and "Advanced".

        1 - Normal mode

Normal mode interface can be split in 3 parts :

            1 - BNC channel setter

This part of the interface is the lefter one.
Here we can divide interface in 8 similar labeled boxes. Each one of this boxes
corresponds to one of the BNC Channels (often named Pulse). A box contains many
informations :
    * Pulse Label (text) : the name you want to give to the Pulse.
    * Pulse state (check box) : whether you want the pulse to be active or not.
    * Pulse width (floating point number) : width of the real TTL pulse in sec
    * Pulse phase (floating point number) : delay between trigger and TTL pulse in sec
    * Pulse phase variation (floating point number) : delay variation in sec

            2 - Observation management frame

Here again, interface can be split in three parts :

                1 - Experiment management

In this part, you can fix your experiment parameters :

    * Total time : total time your observation will take (i.e. the time
        between two triggers).
    * Observation time : integration time of the spectrometers.
    * Averaging number : Averaging number of the spectrometers.
    * Delay number : number of delays you want to do.

                2 - Interpolation management

In this part you can set you interpolation parameters.

    * Starting wavelength : the wavelength you want the spectra to start with
    * Ending wavelength : the wavelength you want the spectra to end with
    * Points number : number of points you want between starting and ending
        wavelengths.
                3 - Reference channel selector
Here is the useful part to manage absorbance reference spectrum,
select here the AvaSpec channel used as reference.

            3 - Scope Display

Here you can select which scope you want to see, note that absorbance scope will
not be displayed before you've selected a reference channel.

        2 - Advanced mode

This is really not useful to interact with BNC using this mode.
But if you want some fine tunes of BNC, you should use this interface.
More informations about how to use and program BNC are given in his own documentation,
given along this file.

    3 - Starting an observation

CALOA is used to perform spectrometry over time using a generator and Avantes
spectrometers.

First of all you will have to enter your parameters in the application.
Enter the total observation time (this is the time between two triggers) in
the Entry labeled "Total time" in milliseconds.
Then enter the integration time of the spectrometers, be careful,
if you use multiple spectrometers, some tests showed that a minimum integration
time of 15 ms is needed.
Then enter the number of averages and number of delays.
Averaging number corresponds to the number of averages for a single delay
number.
Delay number corresponds to the number of times CALOA will delay all
instruments.

You now have to set all parameters for all 8 generator channels.
In each channel cell, as previously mentionned, you can set 5 parameters.
Label can be set to whatever value you want, it is used as a human readable
indentification.
Channel parameters will be set only if State is enabled, if not,
for the sake of time saving other parameters will be skipped.
