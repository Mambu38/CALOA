2 - Installation

Necesites admin privileges.

Installation of CALOA is simple but there is some really important steps that have
to be carefully taken.
Installation is done by an installer which runs all third-party installers usefull
to run CALOA.
If Python 3 is already installed on your computer, it is recommended to uninstall
it to use Anaconda Python 3 instead. Anaconda provides a wide selection of scientific
python libraries. An uninstaller is provided with CALOA Installer to allow you
to easily uninstall Python 3.
Python 2 does not need to be uninstalled.
Installation can be split in 4 parts.

    0 - Connect the spectrometer and the BNC via USB-to-Serial to the computer to be used for installation and operating.

    1 - Installing Anaconda Python

Anaconda Python 3.6 environment (env. 0.5 Gb disk space required) was used to write
the CALOA application, and is used during installation and execution.
During installation, an Anaconda installer window will pop up.
Here is a really important step which have to be taken to use CALAO and successfully
run installation.
During Anaconda installation, while encountering Advanced Installation Options,
select "Add Anaconda to the PATH environment variable", if this step is not taken,
installation will not be complete and CALOA will not be usable.
Appearance of cmd.exe window is is normal, they will be closed afterwards.

In the end of installation, after VSCode installation is prompted, install it.
This will need an internet connection, if you do not have one, there is an installer
along with

    2 - Installing PySerial

PySerial is a module used by Python to communicate with serial ports.
This module will be installed automatically, as long as you have correctly
followed previous steps.

    3 - Installing FTDI CDM Drivers

FTDI CDM Drivers is needed for USB-to-Serial interfacing.
A new installation window will pop-up, simply follow the steps given by the
installer.

    4 - Installing CALOA

This is the program that pilots communication with both BNC generator and Avantes
fiber spectrometers.
Installation will be done automatically.

If all went right, you can choose to start the application

3 - Using CALOA

    1 - Starting CALOA

To start CALOA, simply double click on the CALOA short-cut.
Then a console will run, don't close this console manually, this will cause
CALOA to crash.
In this console, some information will be written, please DO NOT interact
with the console while it is starting, wait for GUI to appear.
After GUI appears, a window like below should appear.
